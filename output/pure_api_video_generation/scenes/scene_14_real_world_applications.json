  "narration": "The impact of the Transformer extends far beyond machine translation. Today, Transformers power a wide range of AI applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. Models like BERT, GPT-3, and PaLM are all based on the Transformer architecture. These models are used for tasks such as text summarization, question answering, code generation, and image captioning.  The Transformer's ability to process sequential data efficiently and effectively makes it well-suited for these applications.  It's become the dominant architecture in many areas of AI, and its influence continues to grow.  From powering search engines to enabling virtual assistants, Transformers are transforming the way we interact with technology.",
