  "narration": "Before we dive into the Transformer, let's establish some foundational concepts. First, a *sequence* is simply an ordered list of items.  A sentence is a sequence of words. A DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides.  Next, a *vector* is a list of numbers.  Think of it as a coordinate in a multi-dimensional space.  Computers represent words and other data as vectors.  Now, how do we turn words into vectors? That's where *word embeddings* come in. Word embeddings are learned representations of words that capture their meaning and relationships to other words.  Words with similar meanings will have similar vectors.  Imagine plotting words on a graph; 'king' and 'queen' would be closer together than 'king' and 'apple'.  These embeddings are crucial because they allow the Transformer to understand the semantic meaning of words.  Finally, we need to understand the concept of a *matrix*. A matrix is simply a 2D array of numbers – a table of vectors.  The Transformer uses matrices extensively to represent and manipulate sequences of vectors.  These are the building blocks we'll be working with.",
